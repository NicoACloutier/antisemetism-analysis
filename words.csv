Alt-right,"“Racist, far-right movement based on an ideology of white nationalism and anti-Semitism. Many news organisations do not use the term, preferring terms like ‘white nationalism’ and ‘far right’. The movement’s self-professed goal is the creation of a white state and the destruction of ‘leftism’, which it calls ‘an ideology of death’. Richard B. Spencer, a leader in the movement, has described the movement as ‘identity politics for white people’. It is also anti-immigrant, anti-feminist and opposed to homosexuality and gay and transgender rights. It is highly decentralised but has a wide online presence, where its ideology is spread via racist or sexist memes with a satirical edge. It believes that higher education is ‘only appropriate for a cognitive elite’ and that most citizens should be educated in trade schools or apprenticeships.” [3]",1,0.749,0.439,0.909,0.229

White genocide,"“White nationalist belief that white people, as a race, are endangered and face extinction as a result of non-white immigration and marriage between the races, a process being manipulated by Jews.
